How to implement the interactions between the farmers and the companies
- We may want to use the seller market:
	- Farmer propose a selling price with some benefits
	- Companies buy by increasing price -> max benefits
	- If not all farmers produce their com. at the same time, companies could wait some time, in order to get offers from all farmers

- We may not want a global seller market, but rather a seller market inside each municipality (depends on what they did on SwissLand)

----------------Farmer side-----------------------------

put on market (already done by add_seller, but maybe as production could change
each year, we could reset the seller market, and farmer should add their self asseller each time they start producing a new com. type, and rm from seller marketif they stop producing a com. 


startProduceNewCom(com: Commodity)
broadcast to seller market (will be asked by companies)

stopProduceCom(com: Commodity)
will not be consider anymore as a seller of this com by companies

price (already done)

---------------Companies side---------------------------
