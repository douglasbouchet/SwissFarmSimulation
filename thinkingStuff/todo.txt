Price in the farms are determined by a 3-year average (section 3.2.1)

Data found on FADN, but only for european member, switzerland isn't ??? 

At t0 (first year), farms has the following infos:
- Production ressources 
- Biographical attributes
- georeferences attributes
(find what they are, but at one point we want to add them)

Farmers make their production decision based on:
- price and yield expectation of previous year (for animals and crop activities)

DIFFERENCE we might do: as mentioned, they make an estimation (based on FADN data of base year + price trends and annual changes), WE can have this number for real (p 17)


The LAND LEASE
ADD to the farm a successor (with a certain probability, 12.5 % of farms should not have any children) (which will take relay when current farmer goes after 65)
If successor, then just transfer the farm 
Else call a land Leasing algorithm 

Farmer also exit of farming if the incomes are negative for for the past 5 years (simple rule but let's implement this atm)
(rules described in chapter 3.3.3 (really read this before coding, they propose an approach at the end of the chapter)

Land Leasing alg: TODO 


THE CONVERSION TO ORGANIC FARMING 

Conversion to organic farming using a bayesean network (obtained from their questionnaires -> fetch what are the data inside those query in chapter 3.3.4 (first paragrahph) e.g farm size, age, sex, educational background)
 
TODO 3.3.5 (mod√©liser le recrutement des gens )
